  title: Create a membership app
  description: >-
    The OpenAPI specification for creating a membership application using the [Paystack API](https://paystack.com/docs/api/).
    
    ### Prerequisites

    1. Sign up on [Paystack](https://paystack.com/signup) to get your secret API key

    2. Set your API key as an environment variable on [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)


    When using the [Subscriptions API](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/subscriptions), Paystack automatically charges the customer at the due time.
    This saves you the need to run scheduled tasks for every customer.
    
    
    While with the [Charge Authorization API](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/recurring-charges), you send Paystack the charge details at the due time.
