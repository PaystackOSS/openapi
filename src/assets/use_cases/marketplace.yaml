    The OpenAPI specification for creating a marketplace application using the [Paystack API](https://paystack.com/docs/api/).
    
    ### Prerequisites

    1. Sign up on [Paystack](https://paystack.com/signup) to get your secret API key

    2. Set your API key as an environment variable on [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)

    
    The [Split API](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/split-payments/) is useful in marketplace apps where the transactions are divided between the platform and the vendor.
    That way, the platform keeps a portion of each transaction.
