  title: Create a wallet app
  description: |
    The OpenAPI specification for creating a wallet application using the [Paystack API](https://paystack.com/docs/api/).
    
    ### Prerequisites

    1. Sign up on [Paystack](https://paystack.com/signup) to get your secret API key

    2. Set your API key as an environment variable on [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/)


    After setting up your secret API key, use the [Customers API](https://paystack.com/docs/api/#customer) to create and validate a customer. 
    You then assign a [Dedicated Virtual Account](https://paystack.com/docs/payments/dedicated-virtual-accounts) to the customer. 


    Transfers in this case refer to moving money to bank accounts and mobile money accounts using our [Transfers API](https://paystack.com/docs/transfers) rather than other wallet users.


    *Dedicated Virtual Account is currently available for [registered businesses](https://support.paystack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009881220-How-do-I-activate-my-Paystack-Registered-Business-) in Nigeria.*
